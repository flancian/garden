# agora setup

So you want to set up an [[agora]]? You're in the right place!

The [[agora]] is meant to be something anyone can run in their laptop or an old computer in a closet -- with some effort, which will hopefully be lowered over time as more development takes place.

The gist of it is: if you try to run an [[agora]] of your own and fail, please reach out to [[flancian]] for help.

You'll need these three repos:

- [[agora]]
- [[agora server]]
- [[agora bridge]]
