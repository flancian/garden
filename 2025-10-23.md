- [[79]]:
  - I was unsure what number I had associated [[Sadhana]] with, but today I saw it in the whiteboard.
  - It was the first prime that seemed "available" on a certain date :) And I think it still is; next up [[83]] is currently yours truly (as I was born on that year), then we only have [[89]], [[91]] and [[97]] left before the hundreds.
  - Before it, I thought [[37]] could be it as I currently associate it with [[Yoga]] which is also a [[spiritual practice]].
- I worked until late and enjoyed it.
- Attended an [[AI summit]] Tue-Thu and I enjoyed it quite a bit! Today I was a bit low energy as I slept only five hours (exceptional occasion) but overall the week was great so far. Actually looking forward to working tomorrow.
