Here again on [[2024-10-12]]. My next actions are:

- [x] experiment with Agora UI w.r.t. stressing the place and action components.
- [ ] maybe make agor.ai work (the root Agora for that network/domain)
- [ ] write to Maitreya and others
- [ ] I still like that [[CHF]] idea
- [x] fix [[org mode]] e.g. [[@jakeisnt]] garden
  - update orgora?

--

Here again on [[2025-04-08]]. I keep looking for a [[root node]] that I defined at some point; I think my problem is that I have several of those -- but maybe also my potential ;)

In any case, I think I may stick with this one and add to this one as a sort of "todo journal".

- [x] Bring up tar.agor.ai or similar in [[tara]] (to get away from remote development, which just isn't working for me as of late -- I spend too much time solving connectivity issues in vscode)

--

[[2025-04-13]]: tar.agor.ai is up since a few days ago :) Now I'm about to start pushing updates to it, and eventually push *something* to prod after quite long without updates in the reference Agora.
