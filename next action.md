Here again on [[2024-10-12]]. My next actions are:

- [x] experiment with Agora UI w.r.t. stressing the place and action components.
- [ ] maybe make agor.ai work (the root Agora for that network/domain)
- [ ] write to Maitreya and others
- [ ] I still like that [[CHF]] idea
- [x] fix [[org mode]] e.g. [[@jakeisnt]] garden
  - update orgora?
