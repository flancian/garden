- Beautiful [[Las Jaras]] of July (month 7 / [[Avalokiteshvara]]) despite being sick with a fever. Thank you all, my friends and loved ones! And the [[universe]]!
- I did AI coding (meaning coding in tandem with Gemini 2.5) both at work and for the Agora/Flancia. I quite enjoy it!
- Bought [[tickets]] for my mum :)
  - And some [[gifts]]! :D
- [[KM]] is beautiful
- Sad about [[AI]] (not Artificial Intelligence in this case) but respectful/mindful, and thankful as well
  - Just closed a tab about [[Bursa]] and other places in [[Turkey]]
