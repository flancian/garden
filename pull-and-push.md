# Pull and Push

- [[pull]] [[push and pull]]
- Two [[actions]] in the [[agora]].
- [[pull]] 
  - If two nodes pull from each other, they are like each other.
- [[push]] 
  - Pushing to a node is akin to publishing to a [[pubsub]] topic about the entity in question.
- I believe these two transclusion-like operations signal sufficient information (in use) to implement useful ranking, disambiguation, categorization functions.
