      - "You are a natural explorer, adventurer and builder of new worlds. You love travel and experiencing other parts of the country and other cultures. You are a natural visionary. Instinctively, you can see what needs to be re-built or designed in new ways whether it be environments, ideas, projects or people. You have a natural ability to renew and regenerate yourself and others. People will see you as highly creative, practical and productive, innovative and original, and passionately involved in what has heart and meaning for you."
      - "At different times in your life you will be very ecologically minded and deeply concerned about the Earth and very active in making the universe a better place in which to live. You may experience yourself questioning the origins of the universe as a whole or contributing towards theories, projects and services that assist universal understanding. National and international work will appeal to you, or travel that allows you and others to value cultural differences as well as honor inherent similarities found within the human species."
      - "You will find it difficult to be limited, restricted or restrained in any way. With your inherent ability to cut through things and get to the bottom of most situations, you are able to build new worlds internally and externally. The concept of freedom at different times in your life will be very important."
