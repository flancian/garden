- I ran into [[Zebras Unite]] again thanks to the Agora.
- #go https://zebrasunite.coop/
- I checked their website and it seems not very updated; there's a reference to a 2023 conference domain which has expired. Twitter seems not updated since 2023. Maybe they didn't make it?
- Then again, Flancia.org is not updated very often either :)
