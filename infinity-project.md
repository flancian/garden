# Infinity Project

- [[go]] https://0oo.li/about/
  - "Homebase is a human-to-human mutual help system to manage global goals, ideas and projects, envisioning a spaceship for humanity with a set course to Infinity."
  - "A place for relax, fun, opinionated discussions and work. You can think of this place, like a living museum of human art of questioning, solving and executing -- here you can find people's quests, ideas and activities, where you can come to add a little piece by piece for others to see, marvel, reflect, and act upon."
