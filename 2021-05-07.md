	- today I left [[foam]] and [[vscode]] behind, at least for now: they just lagged too much.
		- to top things off a vscode update completely wrote editing. I couldn't write anymore in my editor.
	- I [[ditched slugs]] at the file system level: https://social.coop/@flancian/106195626746291723
	- I moved my [[journal]] notes out of the journal directory. This makes sense anyway, as an [[iso 8601]] date should have a [[node]] in the agora as any other interesting entity.

I'm tired of manually auto pulling and auto pushing. I think [[auto push]] and [[auto pull]] need to happen.
