- The weekend was chill and great!
  - Mostly spent time with my mum who is visiting and Lady Burup.
  - We went to the river on Sunday as it was very warm (with my mum, not Lady Burup). It was very beautiful.
- I am talking to someone very interesting and that makes my whole life a bit better as well.
