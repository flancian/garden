- I resigned from the [[Social.coop]] [[Community Working Group]] shortly after finally starting the [[vote to suspend meta]] after much discussion and a quick draft done with the community; it felt like it was time to disengage after I received criticism yet again for 'moving too fast' despite looping in other people on an issue that was burning and making what I thought was a fully pro-social action to advance discussion (start a proposal on Loomio) after it was escalated by multiple community members, including to the CWG.
  - Chiefly about the recommendations was to have more pre-meetings (paraphrasing) and to go slower, even though the issue had been escalated by the community. I am fine not having pre-meetings or anything of the sort and doing more and talking less in 2025 as far as I can, so it seemed like a good moment to finish my CWG engagement (after several years) and focus on the Tech Working Group and the Organizing Circle instead. The CWG is now well-staffed so I am not needed there anymore, which I am thankful for to the people who remain!
