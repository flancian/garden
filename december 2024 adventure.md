- a [[december adventure]].
  - [[2024]] started late you could say :) honestly more towards the end of the month, after my physical adventure to the US and Japan :)
  - I'll take it for however many days it goes!

- [[ActivityPub]] support
- [[Betula]] support
- [[Demo mode]] (just for fun :))
- UX experiments and misc. usability improvements

But I'll start very humbly by...

- [x] make dark mode the default again 
- [x] continue testing restores for social.coop

So, you know, I *did* do those two things... :) And travelled for work and for adventure.

Now continuing on these same directions and a few others in [[January 2025]]...
