- [[Las Jaras]]!
  * We were not completely healthy, [[KM]] and me currently, but I enjoyed living these days together!
  * I was home until midnight with [[KM]] (who went home in the afternoon) and [[Lady Burup]] and then went to [[Zentralwäscherei]] and I loved it.
  * I ran some [[collect]] I had planned for long (more about this tomorrow...).
  * I updated the [[moodboard]].
  * And coded and enjoyed!
