- Yesterday I ended up working on Sunday as planned and I enjoyed it.
  - I also took time to practice, and play, and that made a large difference.
- [[flow state]]:
  - [[flow state radio]]
- I made the move to the office around lunch, now I'm heading into a longish in-office flow session which might last five hours! Wish me luck :)
- [[bull]]:
  - I like the addition of ctrl+s to save a page a lot
  - I'm also using ctrl+e to edit -- maybe it would be ideal if it started the editing session at the end of the document instead of the beginning?
  - Alternatively I think ctrl+s maybe should save but not go back to view mode; unsure.
