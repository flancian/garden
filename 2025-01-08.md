- First time starting a journal node from [[bull]] :)
  - I will be using the opportunity to take notes about the things I would change in Bull over time, as I try to use it as a default [[Agora editor]].
- [[bull bugs]]:
  - I can't seem to be able to indent blocks :) Pressing tab while editing moves to "view site information" in Chromium, which is surprising.
  - Thankfully ctrl+] works, which is awesome and a life saver, but the default behavior could be improved probably?
  - I'm also missing [[vim keys]], which [[Silverbullet]] has, although ideally that could be solved at the editor level; maybe it's an option for the editor module [[bull]] uses?
- [[quotes]]:
  - "I have the solution, you just have to believe in it"
