## Welcome to Flancian's digital garden

This garden is part of the [Agora project](https://anagora.org).

The Agora itself is, of course, part of [Flancia](https://flancia.org).

## Rules of engagement

I publish all notes I take here; I haven't yet implemented a system to tag some notes are private, so you're seeing the whole thing. Please excuse any discomfort.

Notably, these are notes on many topics -- *including people I know*. If you see something written about you that you object to, please let me know and accept my apologies. I will correct it as soon as possible.
