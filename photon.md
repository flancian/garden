- "We are reminded of the process in which a molecule loses or gains a whole atom or a whole electron but never a fraction of one or the other" -- [[Gilbert Lewis]] in [[The Conservation of Photons]].
  - "[[Einstein]] was led to the idea of light quanta which has proved so fertile"
  - "…two photons, as seen by a single observer, differ in direction of motion, in energy and in polarisation".
  - "If we were moving with rapid acceleration toward a wireless station, its photons would appear to possess increasing amounts of energy, and would pass over the whole spectral scale through the visible and into the ultraviolet"
  - "Even so fundamental a process as the flow of heat must involve two factors, the amount of energy and the number of photons transferred"
- > The name photon derives from the Greek word for light, [[φῶς]] (transliterated phôs).
