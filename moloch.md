  - I believe [[humanity]] is [[entangled]] with [[Moloch]].
    - A manifestation of ignorance, greed and lack of coordination which keeps us in a suboptimal space.

    - Moloch is a high dimensional vector against interesting gradients in [[protopoi]], often taking the form of [[violence]] (the dark side of kings, states) and unsolved [[coordination problems]].
      - Sometimes weakened through history after people unlocked new tools for cooperation.
      - Currently includes social evils due to missed opportunities and the tendency of self-sustaining systems to stay put in idiosyncratic equilibriums, local optima.
      - Better optima become available with improvements in availability of resources, and improvements for communication and collaboration.
  - The Agora is my proposal for a tool for giving chase, and maybe out-competing, [[Moloch]].
    - If we ever find or catch up to them, we'll ask them plenty of questions and offer to disentangle from them peacefully first.
    - But I think it is with the [[Commons]] in our inventory as a tool we'll [[slay Moloch]] if we have to.
