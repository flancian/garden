# light

- (This node is old and lightly surprising even to me :))
- a [[thing]].
  - a [[particle]] and a [[wave]]
- a [[process]]?
    - perhaps [[emergent]]?
  - #pull [[photons]]
  - #pull [[fire]]
    - it has been said before: [[come on baby light my fire]].
  - [[beams of light]] seem correlated with [[free energy]]

Every day I try to ask myself: where are my [[lights]]?

It is a [[question]] with many interesting [[answers]].

As of [[2025-03-23]] I ran into [[Gilbert N. Lewis]]'s letter to Nature where he introduced the word [[photon]] into common usage: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon
