  - was quiet but it still felt good to be 'back' :)
- had coffee with my neighbours, it was great!
- cleaned the house a bit
- talked to my mum, I enjoyed it and it was great seeing her
- started a new notebook (ha), this one is a square with a pixel grid -- a gift from the [[nintendo museum]] by [[mpd]]
- [ ] share photos
- [ ] run collect over notebooks and papers, this usually makes me feel better (I have a *lot* of context all around, putting it back in one place/pile usually helps manage it/consolidate)
- [[december 2024 adventure]]
- [[agora writing]]
- had interesting conversations in the [[fediverse]] about:
  - [[ai]]
  - [[sustainability]]
  - leading to [[ilich]], who I still haven't read -- will try to set up his book in my [[kobo]] to read it tonight/soon
- I read about [[recursively enumerable]] sets and languages -- I remembered these were some of my favorite back when I studied computer science when I was 27 or 28. This led me to read again about complexity classes, hierarchies and then [[diophantine]] sets :)
- Also had a great time playing with [[Lady Burup]], and we even watched [[3blue1brown]] together! Pictures likely in the Fediverse :)
