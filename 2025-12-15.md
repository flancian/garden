- I just thought of [[suffering]] and what would amount to [[rational suffering]].
  - Think of the suffering of the beings that die to feed others: some of that suffering is justified inasmuch it enables other conscious beings to subsist.
  - When it is kept to a minimum, of course, we seem to arrive at the ethical optimum. But there are plenty of tradeoffs potentially worth taking.
  - Think of worms getting grown and harvested for feed, but also of the beautiful bird hunted by the cat and the fish who die in the nets of [[fisherpeople]].
