- I just thought of [[suffering]] and what would amount to [[rational suffering]].
  - Think of the suffering of the beings that die to feed others: some of that suffering is justified inasmuch it enables other conscious beings to subsist and negotiate ethical [[tradeoffs]] of their own.
  - When it is kept to a minimum, of course, we seem to arrive at the ethical optimum.
  - Think of worms getting grown and harvested for feed, but also of the beautiful bird hunted by the cat and the fish who die in the nets of [[fisherpeople]].
  - See also: [[trolley science]].
- I also worked and planned the week and did [[Agora]].
- Two days of Agora journaling in a row? Is such a thing even possible? :)
