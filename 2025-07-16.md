- I met [[KM]] this week and it was wonderful!
- The reference Agora at anagora.org is partly broken and the server it mostly depends on nowadays might be on the way out so further downtime could be expected, I'll be noding about troubleshooting activities here and posting to https://social.coop/@flancian/114865307000829931. Please excuse any disruption!
