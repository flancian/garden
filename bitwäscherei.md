## Target
The Bitwäscherei is a space for socialising and exchanging [[knowledge]]. We want to be an inspiring place for #cultural, #technological, #artistic and #social interaction. To this end, we offer a comprehensive infrastructure and help to develop and realise ideas. We work on hardware, digital and conceptual topics and also want to enable the realisation of unusual ideas.

## Uses
The Bitwäscherei provides the framework to enable the participating organisations to use the space in different ways. Individual work is just as welcome as joint projects within the clubs and beyond. We are a community space and have no personal workplaces. We arrange our space in a homely way but do not live here. We offer space for experiments and creative uses and also want to create publicity.

## Interaction
[[Be excellent to each other]]. We treat each other with kindness and support. We respect our own and others' physical and emotional boundaries. We ensure mutual #consent in our actions. In doing so, we emphasise #freedom and personal #responsibility. We do not tolerate discrimination, violence or abusive or disrespectful behaviour in any way within Bitwäscherei. Anyone who engages in sexist, racist, homophobic/transphobic, ableist or other misanthropic behaviour must leave our space. Our [[Care Team]] is the first point of contact if we experience or observe problematic behaviour.

## Awareness
We take care of each other and ourselves and live an active welcoming culture. We greet people who visit the Bitwäscherei for the first time in a friendly manner and explain the organisation of the Bitwäscherei and the rules.
We respect privacy and pay attention to balance when there is heavy use by individuals or when they take up an excessive amount of space (spatially and when making decisions).
