- Back noding!
  * I'm writing this in [[Bitwäscherei]]. The [[Agora]] is being demoed live for the first time! And I've met lots of cool people as usual :)
  * I spent Friday and Saturday with [[KM]] and it was great despite our health not being tip top at times :) 
  * I feel more than lucky; right now, [[blessed]].
- Work has been fine actually; I was oncall this week and was sick two days but I pushed through and felt quite at ease despite sleeping too little.
- [[Las Jaras]] was special as expected!
