- Back noding!
  * I'm writing this in [[Bitwäscherei]]. The [[Agora]] is being demoed live for the first time! And I've met lots of cool people as usual :)
  * I spent Friday and Saturday with [[KM]] and it was great despite our health not being tip top at times :) 
  * I feel more than lucky; right now, [[blessed]].
- Work has been fine actually; I was oncall this week and was sick two days but I pushed through and felt quite at ease despite sleeping too little.
- [[Las Jaras]] was special as expected!
  * I threw [[7]] * [[2^9]] over five dice, notable.
  * [[2063]] made an appearance
  * I ran [[collect]] after planning to for long and it felt cathartic! The [[chaos stack]] which was a bunch of literal back of the envelopes going back to 2024 was reviewed/distilled into a notebook and thus can be put away (or, as indicated in some of the envelopes as intention, [[burnt]].)
- Came after [[2026-01-31]]
- Saw [[Koch]]! And [[Aaron]] and many others.
