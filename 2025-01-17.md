- I went to bed a bit later than expected, at around 3am, but it was a productive night and I still managed to sleep enough so I have no regrets :)
- The [[dishwasher]] repairperson came over, fingers crossed I'll have a dishwasher again! Not having it (after only a few years of having it) really made me appreciate it specially.
- Then I plan to [[work]] mostly on [[AI]] stuff today.
- Then we might go to [[Manor]] with [[AG]] :)
