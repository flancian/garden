- I'm on the [[train back to Zürich]] from Bern.
  - I went to a meeting organized by [[Welle]], an organization working in [[human rights in Iran]].
  - Then I met [[LP]] and we had dinner and a long chat, it was great!
- I will try to work on the Agora while I'm on the train, but maybe I will also just write and read and see where it goes :)
- [[Readers of the future]]
  - Unite? :)
- I read about:
  - [[Manuel Rivas]
  - [[Doomsday argument]]
  - [[Rolando Alarcón]]
