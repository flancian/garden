# M Prime

- [[shorthand]] for a [[framework]] for world building.
  - I want to experiment with this in the [[agora]].
- Take a model of the world, call it [[m]]. It is embedded in [[protopoi]] space.
  - The model [[m prime]] results from applying well-defined transforms, alterations, procedures over [[m]].
    - These transformations, in order, are said to form a [[path]] between [[m]] and [[m prime]].
    - More than one path might link [[m]] and [[m prime]]. Intermediate steps are valid models. 
    - Transformations are modeled as having attributes like [[cost]], [[feasibility]], [[probability]], [[pros]], [[cons]] as evaluated by a diverse community of modelers.
