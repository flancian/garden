- I started this Saturday earlier than usual by waking up at 9am and going to a 10am event in my neighborhood about urban planning :) It was pretty interesting!
- Then did some shopping, meditated and now (as of around midday) I'm starting the day in earnest; drinking [[gyokuro]] and planning the day.
- I hope to [[flow]] all day!
