# Rainbow Folding

- A [[track]] by [[heinali]].
  - [[yt]] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dqimY1OsCA
  - [[spotify]] https://open.spotify.com/album/0QELuZJzws4wmoWfqsjxef?highlight=spotify:track:685xORz372lXXTPPYRjvrM
  - [[go]] [[spotify]]
  - I sometimes listen to this when I try to go to work in the [[agora]]; when I try to achieve [[flow]].
- A [[poem]].
  - As we [[merge]],
    - we'll [[flow]].
  - As we [[fork]],
    - we'll [[glow]].
  - Like a [[rainbow folding]]?
- As of [[2024-08]] I have kindly acquired the rights to publish this track in the [[Agora of Flancia]] and plan to work on embedding a player to begin with :)
