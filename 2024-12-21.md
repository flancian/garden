- Writing this on the flight from [[Tokyo]] to [[Copenhagen]] while on my way back to [[ZÃ¼rich]].
    - I was (lightly) disappointed to see this flight did *not* head northwest as I expected, but rather northeast, despite what the map 'navigation' promised. This told me two things though:
        - "Western" planes are avoiding the whole of Russian airspace, likely because of the war. In retrospect I should have known this!
        - The navigation map available to the public in planes does *not* reflect in any way the course set by pilots. Instead it seems to just show the [[great circle]] to the destination from the current position. This held true through the trip. Indeed, the 'projected path' was roughly orthogonal to the true path at least until we reached the Bearing Strait (which is when I'm writing this).
    - I was planning on catching up on coding and writing (beyond this short entry), but I forgot to charge my laptop and there are no chargers in economy, so there goes that plan :) Well, I have plenty of reading to do so it'll be fine.
