- I'm writing this on the train to [[Bern]], after which I will make a few connections and make my way to [[Puidoux]] where I'll join a [[party in the forest]].
  - It's going to be quite cold tonight and the party goes on until Sunday afternoon, so I'm happy I got some [[Merino]] underpants and a long sleeved shirt yesterday :)
  - I caught up with [[Eerie Shell]] and [[Kris]] over messaging.
- I say [[We Will Defeat Moloch]].
