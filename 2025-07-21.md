- Back home on my free day :) I took the day off to do something with my mum off-peak (meaning not in the weekend). We were going to go to the [[St Beatus Caves]] but due to the weather we changed plans as she wants to go to [[Ikea]] ([[KM]] called it the artificial cave and it's very fitting!).
- I'm typing this on my new small [[RK61]] keyboard and I quite like it! It is a very limited layout as it's only 61 keys, so maybe not ideal for some use cases, but definitely good enough for doing general purpose writing.
