- I'm flying to [[San Francisco]] to work from [[Sunnyvale]] for a few days. As I write this I'm on a SAS A330 sitting in 51A with the seat next to me empty, the plane being about 70% full.
- I started listening to [[Right Concentration]] by [[Leigh Brasington]] (sp?) on the way to Copenhagen where I made my short connection. 
- Now I've finally started properly reading the [[Fediversalist Papers]] (I've been waiting for such an occasion) and found the report immediately engrossing.
  - ...and finished :) I tried taking good enough notes to then share with the Social.coop working groups and organizing Circle.
- I'm still two hours away from San Francisco. Not much more battery left in my laptop, so maybe I'll just keep reading something else.
- I finished reading [[Thich Nhat Hanh]]'s commentary on the [[Heart Sutra]]. I enjoyed it a lot :) Thank you Thich as usual.
  - [[Mindfulness Bell]] is a journal that I'd like to check out.
