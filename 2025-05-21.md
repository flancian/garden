- Today was a good day!
    - Lots happened at work, some of which I dreaded to some small degree without noticing it, most of which went fine and some of which I enjoyed.
    - And then the evening back home with [[Lady Burup]] was beautiful.
- Did [[paperwork]] for the divorce and such, which felt freeing.
- In the morning I met [[Eduardo Alberto]] who will do a deep cleaning of my home soon; it's the first time since I move (I self-clean, and I'm a pretty good "Pareto" cleaner, but don't do deep very well).
- I thought of:
  - [[magnets]] and [[angular momentum]]
  - [[Open Letter to Lex Fridman]]
    - motivated by his (to me overdue) conversation with [[Max Tegmark]], who I realized today is *very* aware about [[Moloch]]!
  - [[Open letters]] in general:
    - I've decided, or realized (or both), that one of the reasons I tend to under perform when writing letters is... because I don't dedicate enough time to it, as in actually planning for it and making time.
    - I decided to set a "soft deadline" of [[August 15th]] for writing to Lex, given that it's his birthday! We're both from 1983.
    - That made me look Max Tegmark's birthday as well and it was recently, on [[May 5th]]. He's from 1967 so I'll associate him with 67 (currently meaning also: light and Amitabha).
