- Today was a good day!
    - Lots happened at work, some of which I dreaded to some small degree without noticing it, most of which went fine and some of which I enjoyed.
    - And then the evening back home with [[Lady Burup]] was beautiful.
- Did [[paperwork]] for the divorce and such, which felt freeing.
- In the morning I met [[Eduardo Alberto]] who will do a deep cleaning of my home soon; it's the first time since I move (I self-clean, and I'm a pretty good "Pareto" cleaner, but don't do deep very well).
