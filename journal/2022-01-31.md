- Back to the workweek :)
	- I cancelled my holidays Mon-Tue to make for a better handoff for my project
	- But I do intend to take some time off through the day / work part time
	- Let's see if that works :)
- [[agora]]
	- [[agora editors]]
		- I like how [[logseq]] shows me the tasks marked as NOW below my journal -- I was missing something like this! It seems the Agora could relatively easily do the same :)
