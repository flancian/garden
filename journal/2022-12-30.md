- worked half a day.
  - "no había tanto, trucha" <- funny comment (but maybe not great, considering the degree of privilege it communicates) because only two Google restaurants were open.
- spent the day with friends who are visiting for New Years! 
- then more friends arrived, and we all had dinner.
- I've been thinking about [[2023]], and about preparing a [[revolutionary calendar]] in the Commons (as an exercise). It won't be ready for Dec 31st -- but that's fine. It'll emerge organically and maybe it's sufficient if it's ready by Jan 31st, or even by June 31st, or even by Dec 31st of 2023 if it need be :)
