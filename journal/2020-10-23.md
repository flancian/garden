# 2020-10-23

- Relatively quiet oncall day.
- Talked to friends: [[S. Z.]], [[A. M.]], [[J. F.]]. [[B. A.]] of course.
- [[videoeditbot]] seems like a good example of a non-trivial twitter-based tool.
- Heard about https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/langston-hughes  [[langston hughes]] thanks to [[barbedcatpenis]].
- Heard about [[integrationism]] thanks to [[ablueaeshna]].
- [[bmock]] told me about his planned comic and it sounds cool. It's about a [[society by animals]] on the edge of [[human civilization]]. Also about [[common sense]] by [[thomas paine]].
- [[levity]] is likely into [[social knowledge graphs]], h/t [[abstractfairy]].
- [[L.]] told me about [[Prisi√≥n Perpetua]] by [[Ricardo Piglia]]. Lots of possible interactions with Flancia I think. I'm going to read it.
