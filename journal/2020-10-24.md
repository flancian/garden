# 2020-10-24

- Ran errands, but it was a beautiful sunny walk.
- Tried to advance the goals of the gentle revolution.
- Great conversations with [[abstractfairy]] and [[ding-levery]].
- Listened to a bit of [[william-macaskill]] with [[lex-fridman]].
  - Remembered [[sean carroll]] and [[mindscape]]. I think it was there where [[william-macaskill]] spoke about the potential of groups researching outside of academia?
