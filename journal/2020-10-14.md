 - [[Agora v0.5]]: publishing
    - [ ] I still have the problem that gatsby-digital-garden does not play well with having notes in many different paths. I should fix it or look elsewhere?
      - Alternative: https://github.com/yenly/foamy-nextjs
    - [ ] Another problem: some pages aren't found.
      - [[Stephen Wolfram]] is found.
      - [[X]] is not (what is X?)
    - published just my digital garden to https://anagora.org for now.
    - Probably need to learn [[Gatsby]] proper today, or part of it. Go through a tutorial?
     - Read about underlying technologies: [[React]], [[GraphQL]]
    - Perhaps should at least check out the [[React]] docs as well.
 - [ ] I'd like to cook [[Baingan Bharta]].
   - https://www.cookwithmanali.com/baingan-bharta/
 - [x] I need to order more coffee
   - [x] [[Utopia Coffee]]
 - Started recording a [[podcast]] in [[anchor.fm]], recommended by [[meshachthomit is a bit clunky, if only because it is actually an extension for a text editor, vscode.as]].
 - I'm really unclear at this point on whether Foam likes filenames-with-dashes or "Filenames Just as the Title".
 - Met [[scottjoe]] on [[foam]] [[discord]]. He's also doing multi-workspaces, calls them 'bottles': https://github.com/scott-joe/foam--workspace.
