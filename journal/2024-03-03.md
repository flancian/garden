- Apparently there was some sort of controversy about a site called [[content nation]] in the Fediverse, and people from [[Mastodon]] came across as conservative/resistant to change/unfriendly to newcomers. I am not surprised.
  - Good thing is I found [[wedistribute]] via the article linked in the node above, and I think I'm liking this site and maybe particularly a podcast they have called [[decentered]].
- I read about [[Jim Simons]] and the [[Medallion fund]] after watching [[Veritasium]]'s [[The Trillion Dollar Equation]].
- I read about [[Jizo]] a.k.a. [[Ksitigarbha]], which I now associate with number [[6]] (as he vowed to liberate beings in all six Buddhist realms).
