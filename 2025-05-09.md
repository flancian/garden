- I just resolved all [[chezmoi]] conflicts in [[paramita]] and it felt a bit like glory honestly. I also cleaned up the repository in a variety of ways. It took about 20 minutes and it felt very freeing.
  - I then launched [[nvim]] and it *worked* after being broken in this machine still; all my modules got auto-installed immediately and it felt like living in the future, which of course I do in many ways being very privileged (and remembering [[William Gibson]]...).
  - And of course I spoke just a little too soon, somehow Markdown mode in [[wikivim]] is not quite perfect for some reason :)
