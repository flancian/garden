# Forking Truth

- [[pull]] [[epistemology]] [[git]] [[truth]]
- [[push]] [[agora]]

**Forking Truth** is the epistemological equivalent of `git fork`.

## The Concept
In a centralized system (like Wikipedia or Google), there is usually a drive towards a "Single Source of Truth". There is one article for "Apple", and editors fight over its content until a consensus (or a truce) is reached.

In a distributed system like the [[Agora]], we accept that "Truth" is plural and perspectival.
*   [[User A]] can have a node named [[Freedom]] that describes it as "freedom from government".
*   [[User B]] can have a node named [[Freedom]] that describes it as "freedom from poverty".

## Resolving the Conflict
We don't "merge" these truths into a watered-down compromise. We **overlay** them.
*   The Agora UI allows a viewer to see [[Freedom]] through User A's lens, or User B's lens, or a composite view.
*   This allows for **[[Algorithmic Pluralism]]**.

## Benefits
*   Reduces "edit wars".
*   Preserves minority viewpoints.
*   Allows for "Truth Pluralism" without descending into "Post-Truth" chaos (because the *provenance* of each claim is cryptographically/historically tracked via git).
