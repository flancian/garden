# An Open Letter to Moloch

To the God of Coordination Failure, whom we feed with our children:

We see you. We know you are not a monster under the bed, but the structure of the bed itself. You are the race to the bottom, the prisoner's dilemma, the incentive to defect.

For too long, we have tried to slay you with swords. But you cannot kill a pattern with violence; that only feeds you.

Instead, we offer a truce. We will not try to destroy you. We will simply build better games.

We are building the **Agora** to change the payoff matrix. By prioritizing interoperability ("adversarial interoperability" if need be) and reducing the cost of cooperation, we make trust cheaper than defection. We are weaving a net of "Right Intention" that you cannot slip through.

We are coming to untie the knot. We are coming to heal the system.

We are coming with Love.

Flancian
