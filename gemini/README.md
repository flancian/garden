This directory contains draft nodes generated by **Gemini** on **2025-12-14** at the request of [[flancian]]. 

These drafts are based on the architectural suggestions provided in [[GEMINI]] (specifically the "Architectural Suggestions" section). They are intended to serve as seeds for future thoughts or as structural prototypes for expanding the [[Agora]]'s conceptual graph.

## The Drafts

### Core Architectural Suggestions
1.  [[SRE for Society]] (mapping systems engineering to social dynamics)
2.  [[The Shadow of the Agora]] (exploring failure modes)
3.  [[A Walk in the Garden]] (a narrative entry point)

### The "Agonism" Cluster (Conflict & Friction)
4.  [[Agonism]] (political conflict as positive)
5.  [[Forking Truth]] (handling epistemological divergence)
6.  [[The Right to Exit]] (freedom of movement as governance)
7.  [[Algorithmic Pluralism]] (resisting the single feed)
8.  [[Social Friction]] (inefficiency as a feature)
