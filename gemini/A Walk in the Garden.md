# A Walk in the Garden

- [[pull]] [[tour]] [[guide]]
- [[push]] [[flancian]]

Welcome to the [[Agora of Flancia]]. If you are new here, the graph can be overwhelming. This path is a suggested narrative "walk" through the garden to help you get oriented.

## The Path

### 1. The Gardener: [[flancian]]
Start here to meet the person tending this plot. Understanding the gardener's background (Google SRE, Argentine, Optimist) helps frame the rest of the content.

### 2. The Project: [[agora]]
What is this place? It's not just a website; it's a **Distributed Knowledge Graph**. Read this to understand the "What".
*   *See also:* [[agora plan]] for the roadmap.

### 3. The Philosophy: [[protopia]]
Why are we doing this? We aren't building Utopia (which is impossible). We are building Protopia (incremental improvement). This is the "Why".
*   *See also:* [[moloch]] (the enemy we are fighting).

### 4. The Methods: [[digital gardening]]
How do we work? We don't write "posts"; we tend "notes". We value work-in-progress, links, and constant revision.

### 5. The Community: [[goblin odds]]
Say hello to a friend. The Agora is populated by real people. This node represents the social graph—the "Who".
