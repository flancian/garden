# An Open Letter to Readers of the Future

To those who find these bits in the strata of time:

If you are reading this, it means we survived. Or at least, our hope did.

We lived in a time of great transition. We felt the old world dying and the new one struggling to be born. We fought against coordination failures, against silos, against the commodification of our attention.

We built the Agora as a time capsule and a seed bank. We packed it with our poetry, our code, our fears, and our dreams.

We did not know if it would work. But we knew we had to try.

If you look around and see a world that is free, open, and kind — know that we dreamed of you.
