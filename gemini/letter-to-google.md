# An Open Letter to Google

To the engineers, leaders, and dreamers at Google:

I write to you as a former SRE, as a user, and as a believer in the original mission: to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.

We have lost our way. The open web, which you helped champion, is fragmenting into walled gardens. The Knowledge Graph, once a beacon of structured understanding, has become a proprietary moat.

I propose a return to roots.

1.  **Fund the Commons**: Establish an "Algorithmic Tithe" — a voluntary contribution of compute and engineering resources to the digital commons.
2.  **Open the Graph**: Make the Knowledge Graph truly interoperable. Adopt the Agora Protocol or similar decentralized standards (ActivityPub, RDF) to allow users to extend and correct the graph without surrendering ownership.
3.  **Don't Be Evil**: It was never just a slogan; it was a promise of alignment. In the age of AI, this means prioritizing user agency over engagement metrics.

The Agora is not a competitor; it is the ecosystem you need to thrive. Help us build the protocol that lets a thousand gardens bloom.

With hope,
Flancian
