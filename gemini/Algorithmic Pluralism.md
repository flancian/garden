# Algorithmic Pluralism

- [[pull]] [[algorithms]] [[feed]]

**Algorithmic Pluralism** is the right to choose the algorithm that curates your view of the world.

## The Problem
On platforms like [[Twitter]], [[TikTok]], or [[Facebook]], there is one "Feed". It is a black box optimized for engagement (and often outrage). You cannot change it; you can only submit to it.

## The Agora Solution
In the [[Agora]], because data is decoupled from the view layer:
*   We can have multiple "Feed Algorithms".
*   **Algorithm A:** "Show me notes from my friends sorted by date."
*   **Algorithm B:** "Show me notes that disagree with my current worldview (Agonistic Discovery)."
*   **Algorithm C:** "Show me random connections (Serendipity)."

## User Agency
The user should be able to toggle these algorithms as easily as changing a CSS theme. This prevents the "Reality Tunnel" effect of monolithic social media.
