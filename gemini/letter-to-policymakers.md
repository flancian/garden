# An Open Letter to Policymakers

To those who write the code of law:

The digital world is not a separate realm; it is the infrastructure of our society. Just as we tax commerce to fund roads and libraries, we must recognize the need for **Digital Public Infrastructure**.

I propose the **Algorithmic Tithe**:

Corporations that profit from the mining of collective human attention and data should be required to contribute a percentage of their compute or revenue to the **Digital Commons**. This fund would support:

*   Open protocols (ActivityPub, Matrix, Agora).
*   Public service media and diverse algorithms.
*   Data sovereignty tools that allow citizens to own and port their digital identities.

We cannot leave the architecture of our democracy to advertising companies. It is time to fund the digital roads we all rely on.
