- [[bull]] now supports tabs in editing mode :)
  - enjoying it a lot!
  - I am thinking of which other quality of life improvements could easily be added to [[CodeMirror]] if Stapelberg agrees.
  - [[vim mode]] is probably going too far? :)
- I realized I broke links in [[Agora graphs]] when I pushed the update to remove jquery; I know why, I just need to remember to fix it tonight after work.
  - [ ] fix it then :)
