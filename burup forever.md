# burup forever

- a [[project]]
  - [[lady burup]] is heavier than she "should" be according to what we've read (for optimal health), so we're going to try to have her go into calorie-conscious mode
  - as of [[2021-08-29]] she weighs 4.8kg
    - her target weight is: 4kg
    - that's a 16.6% loss
  - [[opinions]]
    - [[royal canning gastrointestinal fibre response]] says a 4kg cat of regular weight should eat 53gr of this dry food a day

- Back here on [[2025-03-09]], Burup weighed 5.8kg today (measured by the process of weighing myself first, then weighing me with her)
  - So the above didn't quite work, although on the other hand we've been very happy together, so...)
  - New feeding plan notes follow.
    - today I weighed Burup (5.8kg it seems, she would probably be healthiest at around 4.5kg), and the futter that the feeder gives her, plus quantified numbers of the two kinds of futter I give by hand; plus I did calculations with all these to determine how much should Burup eat daily :)
    - she should lose 1.5kg but slowly, and I think eating 50-60g futter-equivalent per day is a good idea to start. I will try to feed her about a quarter of her calories as wet food and snacks, and the rest as futter.
    - for future reference: a dose of the automatic feeder is 7.5g of the futter that the feeder has, and 17 of the ones with the hole (simba) and about 25 of the ones without (premium star) also total 7.5g.
    - she should get a maximum of 7 such futter doses daily for a total of ~52.5g of futter provided she gets no snacks and no wet food; if she gets between a third and a half of a tuna can at night, and four snacks a day, that would be more like 4-5 doses (depending on how much of the can and how many snacks).
    - so with one futter dose during the night, one in the morning, one in the afternoon (when I get home from work) and one before bed (~30g of futter on top, like I say, of the wet food and snacks) she should be plenty fine while losing some weight.
