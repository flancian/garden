- A [[list]].
  - Of things I want/wanted to do.
  - To be strict, this is more of a [[graph]], but you get the idea ;)
  - See also: [[do]], for the alternate (maybe more regular) phrasing, and other nodes such as [[next action]], [[agora plan]].

This is one of those nodes that must begin with an introduction, or if the bullet list in nodes usually serves as introduction, then a pre-introduction :)
I have so many todos that my todos often have their own todos. They are distributed around my computers, around my home, around the office.

As of [[2025-03]] I'm making a "fresh start" in the sense that I intend to come back here and actually clean up and order things, and try to keep this in roughly priority order so that the things I'm working on next are roughly towards the top. Let's see if it works!

## [[2025-03]]

- [ ] write in the [[zine]], I've been writing in my head for a while and it's time to do some actual writing?
- [ ] test mastodon [[agora bot]] "fix"
- [ ] fix [[betulagora]]
- [ ] respond to the email from Mike Kupfer.
- [ ] check out the link(s) that [[smurp]] sent to me
- [ ] process his signup to the Agora! which I saw just before leaving for travel, looking forward :)
- [ ] do some small FR for [[bull]]? which one?
- [ ] fill the [[LabÃ¶r]] survey

## [[2023]] and earlier

- Meta: Instead of deleting many of these, I may just copy/paste the ones I still want to do above?
- [ ] [[write]] to [[hans widmer]]
  - I didn't do this yet but I met him in [[Paranoia Verlag]] and spoke to him shortly :)
  - -> This would go well into an [[open letter to hans widmer]] node?
- [[answer]] Riccardo on Foam discord
  - I am not using Foam, so I think I will deprioritize this -- although I like [[Riccardo]] and [[Foam]] still!
- Go over my [[twitter todo]] and move items to the agora
  - Update: huh, this is so old that I have since both 1. stopped using Twitter (now X) as Elon Musk shut down API access, and 2. been suspended from X for no clear reason and with no recourse/answer to my questions about motivation.
  - https://flancia.org/go/twitter-todo.
  - I have mostly moved on from [[Twitter]] due to [[Muskgate]] and such :)
  - The [[Fediverse]] has replaced it in a way; I think the right [[next action]] here likely has to do with that.
    - And/or [[Bluesky]]?
- [[answer]] https://twitter.com/peternlimberg/status/1301937727588503554
  - https://thestoa.substack.com/p/just-fucking-send-it [[peternlindberg]] [[read]]
  - https://thestoa.substack.com/p/the-dark-forest [[peternlindberg]] [[read]]
  - ? I am currently on a plane offline but these look intriguing. I think it's about that philosopher's house in SF I once found?
- [x] Become a contributor for [[social.coop]]: https://opencollective.com/socialcoop
  - [x] [[tweet]] about it
  - [x] [[tweet]] about opencollective.com: https://opencollective.com/flancia
  - [x] Sign into social.coop
  - I have definitely become a contributor since :) So, yeah... this is actually done! See [[social coop tech group]], [[twg]], [[organizing circle]] and such.
- [x] [[read]] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse
  - This probably happened since :) I actually have learnt a lot about the Fediverse, and participated, since I wrote this.
  - The Agora has even had an Agora bot in the Fediverse for years now, currently at social.agor.ai :)
  - So I guess I *did* do some things!
- [ ] [[read]] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSocial
  - I think I read this but I'm unsure so I'll leave this open.
- [[write]] about things people want to read about: https://twitter.com/flancian/status/1305069564158500865
  - [ ] [[write]] "Minimum set of requirements, necessary and sufficient, for Flancia to sprout and flourish. In other words: Why can't we get it done by the end of today (GMT)?"
  - [ ] [[write]] "Is there a place for aesthetic transcendence in Flancia?"
    - Trascendence: "to touch the infinite" 
    - Watch https://twitter.com/codexeditor/status/1261626600010866688 recommended by [[Codex]]
    - "Would be interested to hear your thoughts on agorae" by [[cklorentzen]]
- [x] [[read]] about [[Jainism]]
  - I did this at some point, and I also read a lot of Buddhist suttas, some of which touch on Jainism :)
- [x] Advance [[Go Links]]
    - Add some graphs?
    - "[[TODO]]: research open source ways of drawing 1. protocol diagrams and 2. graph visualizations. Is dia the best there is, or should I use something higher level? This is sort of implicitly blocking calling my [[Go Links]] post finished."
    - Edit
    - [x] Post to Twitter
- [x] [[read]] something by [[meaningness]]
  - This totally happened at some point.
- [[write]] a sci fi short story about [[orthodox jews that wear 80s clothing]]
  - Wow, this was unexpected :) I don't remember the context at all..
  - [ ] Hmm, now I do :) It was funny, maybe I should still do it? Where do I keep all my fictional + potentially funny ideas again?
- [[write]] [[Twitter report]]
  - Or adopt suggestions in thread if any?
  - I don't remember what this was about and X has broke ties with me for some reason, so I guess this just didn't happen in this timeline!
- [x] [[think]] about https://twitter.com/flancian/status/1297295559133462529
- [x] Get back to: https://twitter.com/dpovey1/status/1296681168142655490
- [x] Read [[ribbonfarm]] as recommended by [[AbstractFairy]]
- [[read]] the original (?) blog post about [[digital garden]]s.
  - Which one?
- [x] Respond to email from [[social.coop]]
- [x] Investigate social.coop, set up donation.
- [x] [[write]] [[Agora for EA]].
  - Hmm, EA is having reputation problems nowadays after Scammy McScamPants did FTX and such. Just this week someone called me an idiot in the Fediverse because of trying to "defend" the reasonable core of EA.
  - [ ] Maybe [[Agora for Altruism]] is a better framing?
- [x] [[read]] [[Zhuangzi]] as recommended by [[ikesharpless]]
- [x] [[code]] [[Twitter Go Links]]
  - I think I did this? I mean, I did have the Agora bot running on Twitter until Musk killed it...
- [ ] [[write]] [[Caramel City]]
  - The draft is still there, published since its inception. It's weird how much of it has come so much closer to real...
- [x] [[code]] [[Roam Go Links]]
  - Dropped Roam as a personal platform.
- [ ] [[read]] [[bolo'bolo]]
- [ ] [[read]] [[Binding Chaos]]
- [ ] [[read]] [[Seeing like a State]]

## Done
- [x] Meta: fix go links that pointed to Roam. 
- [x] Figure out [[Foam]] rendering to [[github pages]]
  - Made obsolete by the Agora.
- [x] [[Agora v0.5]] -- here is where block references would come in handy :)
