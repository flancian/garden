- I'm writing this on my way to [[Japan]] ([[Fukuoka]]) from [[Honolulu]] :)
  - I just finished [[Story of your life]] and other stories by [[Ted Chiang]], I liked it a lot. I don't know why I waited so long to read him more intensively after liking some of his short stories I read online.
  - Some related concepts/topics:
    - [[Fermat's Principle of Least Time]]
    - [[The Castle of the Pyrenees]] by [[Magritte]]
  - He likes [[Borges]] (so do I as you might know). This came across most clearly maybe in his [[Golem]] related story, but there's such an undercurrent in several stories and he uses the adjective [[Borgesian]] (IIRC) once.
