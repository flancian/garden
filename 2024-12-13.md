- I'm writing this on my way to [[Japan]] ([[Fukuoka]]) from [[Honolulu]] :)
  - I just finished [[Story of your life]] and other stories by [[Ted Chiang]], I liked it a lot. I don't know why I waited so long to read him more intensively after liking some of his short stories I read online.
  - Some related concepts/topics:
    - [[Fermat's Principle of Least Time]]
    - [[The Castle of the Pyrenees]] by [[Magritte]]
  - He likes [[Borges]] (so do I as you might know). This came across most clearly maybe in his [[Golem]] related story, but there's such an undercurrent in several stories and he uses the adjective [[Borgesian]] (IIRC) once.
- [[Agora development]]:
  - [[agora bot migration]]:
    - The current [[agora bot]] for Mastodon is still ceasing to work on [[2024-12-15]] as per https://muffinlabs.com/posts/2024/10/29/10-29-rip-botsin-space/ but I have failed to do anything about it... until now :)
    - To start with, I've now requested a post archive to save the ~14k posts it has produced since it started operating ~two years ago.
    - I'll also look for an alternate instance, and try to set up a migration flow (for keeping followers).
