- I'm back!
  - In [[computer space]] (and time!)
  - Travelling was great but I'm looking forward to catching up with projects.
- [[Agora]]:
  - Discussed [[2025]] with [[Timur]] in [[Flancia Meet]], also discussed [[Betula]] progress which is very exciting!
  - Thought about [[Fediverse]] integration, [[auth]] and data providers.
  - Also about simpler and more opaque stuff like [[autopull for numbers]]: number [[n]] should pull e.g. [[prime/n]] because that's a related node for all integers.
  - Hmm, what was by [[root node]] again...? :)
