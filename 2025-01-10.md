- I'm writing this with my new mechanical keyboard, a [[keychron q3 max]].
    - I got this for the office because the previous one was a bit too noisy for the office environment; not that I was the only one using a mechanical keyboard, or that the switches were the noisiest you could get, but I felt like I was contributing to a less inclusive than necessary environment by typing loudly with my headphones at times. And I really like typing with my headphones on :)
    - The one that I got, with [[gateron brown switches]], is really quite silent! And I like the tactile feedback enough.
    - I am enjoying the typing experience so I'm glad!
    - The one thing I would add is maybe a palm rest. I don't usually use one, but this keyboard is high enough that I feel like that could make it more ergonomic.
    - Sometimes it seems to double-register my space bar presses though, which is a bit disconcerting -- I hope it's a matter of adjusting my typing style to the switches and not a hardware issue! I'll keep an eye on it.
      - Maybe [[NKRO]] is a factor here? Trying the recommendation in https://www.reddit.com/r/Keychron/comments/1ba9vxy/comment/l9bu0ys
