- An addendum.

I miss you. I know you will probably never read this, and that is alright; I do want you to be free. But I needed to say that I wish I would have been more mindful when interacting with you, more loving in a less impulsive way; I wish I would have given us more time to know each other.

I still hope some day we will resume our friendship, but I don't want to impose that hope on you -- in the sense that I want to respect your wishes.
