- My [[noding]] has become erratic :) In particular my journaling is less consistent than before.
  - Introspecting, this seems to be because of a combination of causes (as usual):
    - I have been spending time in working around computer bugs (like [[karuna]] crashing, my work keyboard being temporarily bricked by a firmware update, etc.) and working.
    - I lost or temporarily misplaced my [[default environment]], meaning the computer+workspace that I prefer for noding in the absence of temporary factors like being at some other computer.
