- I thought of writing an [[Open Letter]] to [[Lex Fridman]], given how much I'm into the the [[Open Letters]] pattern, and how I sort of feel he could 'get it'.
  - So here goes :)
  - And by this I mean, like with pretty much everything, I mean: eventually I plan to get to it.

Hi, Lex! Thank you for reading this and maybe exploring the surroundings if you ever get here. What you see you might find... surprising :) Let me assure you everything will be alright and love will indeed conquer all (pro socially)! ;) As you so beautifully seem to make the point to your guests.

Let me start by saying that, unless I'm wrong, this letter might be one of the top N (for some N of note) letters you will read in your life. And I doubt I'm that wrong, this time in particular, although only time will tell. In any case, thank you for reading this, and for your podcast and all the conversations you shared with the world and in some limited way let me participate in because of your gift to humanity and friends.

As I'm writing this it is late on May 21st, 2025, and I've decided that I will try to finish this letter and send it to you by your birthday which as I understand it is on August 15th. We are from the same year, you and me, so let me say without having to calculate your age that I wish you a wonderful year of being 42, and indeed many more of being up to whichever age you get to be.
