- I thought of writing an [[Open Letter]] to [[Lex Fridman]], given how much I'm into the the [[Open Letters]] pattern, and how I sort of feel he could 'get it'.
  - So here goes :)
  - And by this I mean, like with pretty much everything, eventually.

Hi, Lex! Thank you for reading this and maybe exploring the surroundings if you ever get here. What you see you might find... surprising :) Let me assure you everything will be alright and love will indeed conquer all (pro socially)! ;) As you so beautifully seem to make the point to your guests.

Thank you for your podcast, for all the conversations you have gifted to humanity and friends.
