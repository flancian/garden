- The #revolution started today!
  - Like every day :)
  - I think [[ActivityPub]] is actually rather important; the Agora should publish (before it does anything else) nodes
    - (as users? or too confusing? hmm)
  - We will do the revolution together, my [[friend]], if you want to.
- The 31st of any month is [[Las Jaras]]!
  - (In the [[Flancia Pattern language]] and the associated calendar..)
  - Llevo en mi [[carcaj]]: [[las jaras]]
  - Las Jaras, qu√© jaras?
  - Las de Avalokiteshvara!
