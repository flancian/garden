# Nagarjuna

  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagarjuna
  - There is two modes of knowing:
    - [[relative truth]]
    - [[ultimate truth]]
      - [[ken wilber]] says [[prajna]] / [[gnosis]] / [[knowledge]] are all related (jn/gn/kn)
  - You can't use the relative mind to think of the ultimate. 
    - Demonstrated that for every concept X, ultimate reality is;
      - not x
      - not not x
      - not both
      - not neither (?)
    - "not even wrong"
