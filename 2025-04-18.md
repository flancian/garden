- Fixed [[wikivim]] on neovim :)
  - Yep, even bulleted lists :)
    - I can even use tab and shift-tab to indent/dedent!
  - It took a few tries but now vim feels like a nice Agora noding environment again, in particular in the computer where I now have my development environment up -- [[tara]].
- Back again after sleep :)
  - I have a nice focus day in front of me; I'll try to get through a varied task list that I will keep partly here and partly on the back of an envelope that I intend to burn at the end of the day.
- Spoke to my mum!
  - She found some books that belonged to my grandfather, [[Bargall√≥]].
