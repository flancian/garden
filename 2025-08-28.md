- Noding from work :)
- I spent the last few days:
    * With my mum, enjoying her last days in ZÃ¼rich this year.
    * With [[KM]], in [[Copenhagen]] for the first time -- it was great!
    * Working, mostly catching up with procedural things but also doing some AI stuff.
    * Playing (after work), mostly coding the Agora with AI. It's a wonderful experience!
