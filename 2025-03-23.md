- Traveling to the US today!
  - As I write this I'm typing on my laptop on an American flight from [[Heathrow]] to [[Durham]].
  - I've been reading and listening to audiobooks:
    - I started [[Flowers for Algernon]] on the flight from ZÃ¼rich, it's already quite moving (as expected).
    - Then I continued [[Memories of Hadrian]].
    - Then I started an [[Introduction to Systems Thinking]] by [[Donella Meadows]] called [[Thinking in Systems]].
- Yesterday I thought again quite a bit about:
  - [[light]]
  - [[momentum]]
  - [[entropy]]
  - Quiz: what do momentum and entropy have in common?
