- Traveling to the US today!
  - As I write this I'm typing on my laptop on an American flight from [[Heathrow]] to [[Durham]].
  - I've been reading and listening to audiobooks:
    - I started [[Flowers for Algernon]] on the flight from Zürich, it's already quite moving (as expected).
    - Then I continued [[Memories of Hadrian]].
    - Then I started an [[Introduction to Systems Thinking]] by [[Donella Meadows]] called [[Thinking in Systems]].
- Yesterday I thought again quite a bit about:
  - [[light]]
    - led me to read [[photon]] in Wikipedia, very nice article!
  - [[momentum]]
  - [[entropy]]
  - Quiz: what do momentum and entropy have in common?
- [[Waking up]]:
  - It turns out there's going to be a community meetup in Zürich on [[2025-04-01]]!
  - Maybe I could check it out. For more, see the email from [[2025-03-22]].
- I need to do somthing to bring [[todo]], [[do]], [[next action]] and such under control :)
  - To begin with I think I just need to re-pick one as the 'root' and start going through it and try to keep my actual priorities at the top.
  - It's going to be painful (because of the amount of stuff I've amassed! and the fact that even after all this I won't be able to have all my todos there because I have a parallel life at work...) but probably worth it, so maybe I should just get right on with it.
  - -> done! I refactored [[todo]] a bit, and went through very old todos and actually found them even done. Maybe there's a tune to the chaos I seem to operate in after all, at least some of the time ;)
- I think having an offline wikipedia could be nice. Or a language model that I can run locally, albeit slowly, but hey... that will come :)
- I enjoyed reading [[The discrete charm of the Turing machine]] by [[Greg Egan]]. This was in [[Instantiation]]; previously (in February) I read [[The Best of Greg Egan]], a selection of his short stories, and enjoyed them a lot!
  - He's definitely one of my favorite living writers.
