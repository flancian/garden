- A lovely Saturday with [[KM]] and [[Lady Burup]] at home. Relaxing and interesting. With [[KM]] we did a nice walk in Zürich in the cold weather, knowing it will just keep getting colder.
- The week was pretty brutal at work (3x presentations, 2x reviews, plus planning and some ad hoc meetingsd) -- it feels great now that it's in the past though. I feel I 'survived' the last tricky week of the work year; things should quiet down from now on as people start going into holidays mode.
