- [ ] A lovely saturday with [[KM]] and [[Lady Burup]]. Relaxing and interestAing.
- The week was pretty brutal at work (3x presentations, 2x reviews, plus planning and some ad hoc meetingsd) -- it feels great now that it's in the past though. I feel I 'survived' the last tricky week of the work year; things should quiet down from now on as people start going into holidays mode.
