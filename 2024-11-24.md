- Still recovering from disease (flu? covid? unsure) with [[AG]] -- but feeling better thankfully, both of us.
- Ended up testing [[backup restores]] for [[social.coop]] finally and it felt great! It was in the todo list for long.
- Not so much progress on [[work-work]] this weekend -- which I know might sound a bit weird, why is it that I sometimes plan to work on the weekends? The truth is that some of the things I need to do I find it hard to do during the week for a variety of reasons, like meeting load. So I sometimes use the weekend to catch up. But when I don't I have to at some point 'let go of it', else it weights on me implicitly.
- Spoke to my mum over [[Meet]] and it was great!
