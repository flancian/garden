- Good day at work!
  - Started cycling season by biking to work, which was great :)
  - Then good progress on some fronts, and a pleasant evening at home with Lady Burup and working a bit more.
  - Thinking about the future in a pleasant way.
- TIL about [[Mahasthamaprapta]], one of the two attendants of [[Amida Nyorai]]/[[Amitabha]] with [[Avalokiteshvara]]! Gemini told me about them, a.k.a. [[Dashizhi]] in feminine form.
