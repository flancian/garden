# 2021-03-01

- Welcome to [[march]]! The first sixth of 2021 started interesting.
- [[other agoras]]
- [[music]] [[electronica]]
  - [[rival consoles]]
  - [[Jon Hopkins]]
  - [[Nils Frahm]]
- [[push]] [[google search]] 
  - I heavily dislike how [[google]] changes search results so that
    - their url looks fine on hover, but changes to a tracking URL when clicking them
    - the original urls can't be copied, it is the tracking URL that gets copied
  - https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/391644-fix-google-ulr-redirects plus [[greasemonkey]] fixes that
- [[lyra]] is impressive
- [[mind uploading and the revolution]]
