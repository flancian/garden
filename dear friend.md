- a [[letter]].
  - you find in the [[Agora]].

My dear friend, my executor -- maybe the executor of my will --:

I thank you, first of all, for meeting me here.

After reading this you might be left wondering how much of this is real and how much is fiction. This will hopefully become evident with time; but from all I offer in this Agora and in my papers, feel free to take what is useful and leave the rest.
