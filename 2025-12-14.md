- I finally finished the migration from 'main' to 'master' for the Agora root, belatedly :)
- I had a great day on [[2025-12-13]] with [[KM]] and [[Lady Burup]]. Thank you!
- New Agora signup! Welcome [[@matthieuG]] :)
- I did some [[Agora development]] with Gemini and made what felt like surprising progress on two of the main December objectives:
  * [[Easier signups]].
    + Completed: 'join with your git repo' now exists as a form, talks to [[agora server]] and that talks to the (privileged) [[agora bridge]].
  * [[Federation++]]
    + Completed: send /latest subnodes per user to followers we know of.
