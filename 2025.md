- a [[year]] :)
    - For some reason I didn't start this node until April, [[2025-04-17]] to be more precise.
    - But I've written a lot *about* this year in the [[Agora of Flancia]].

- Jan-Mar: AI work, beautiful trip, breakup, some breakthroughs.
- April: As I write this, I go into a sidequest

## Sidequests

- Bring up alpha.social.coop
  - -> continue PR
- Buy tickets for my mum
- - -> Plan the year, which is what brought me here :)
- [x] Make [[wikivim]] work in [[neovim]] :)
- [x] Join [[SGMK]]

## Manifesto

Oh wow yes, how good it feels to be living this. 

Thank you, [[reader]], for being here with me, now and always.
