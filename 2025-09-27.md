- Life is beautiful.
  * I am sorry for the oppressed at the same time I cherish highly my level of privilege and enjoyment; this much is true. What I do for them is probably inefficient and insufficient; I will try to do better.

As I write this on [[2025-09-27]] I am surrounded by happiness in the company of [[Lady Burup]] and [[KM]]. I am deeply thankful for what I get to live.

After work I usually code until late, with two AIs in two computers in two different desks, and play around the house with ~5 other computers and conscious beings.
