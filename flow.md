# Flow

 a [[mental state]]
  - Of persistent [[focus]].
  - Can be enjoyable, constructive, pro social.
  - #wp https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)
    - As defined by [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]] (I can never remember how to spell his name).
    - "In positive psychology, a flow state, also known colloquially as being in the zone, is the mental state in which a person performing some activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity. In essence, flow is characterized by the complete absorption in what one does, and a resulting transformation in one's sense of time."
- an [[action]].
  - in the [[Agora]] of Flancia, optionally :)
- a [[project]]
  - by [[david-gelernter]] and [[eric freeman]]

- #pull [[flow state]]

I don't enter flow as often as I would like and that usually frustrates me; it's low key frustration but frustation nevertheless, and it builds up the longer it is sustained. It's like a part of my brain knows that we should get back to it, but life gets in the way; or, most often, I just procrastinate on triggering the right conditions.

Sometimes I like to get into flow with a [[quick fix]].

      - Actually unrelated to the 30 days of yoga linked above, but I like this one a lot and it's "flow on the go" so it seems fitting that it's the default [[go link]] :)

I am back here on [[2024-05]] during [[live noding]]. I am trying to write in what passes for my [[long form]] these days, which is when I jot a few phrases that don't come in bullet points or are chat messages :)

Working on [[open letters]] and enjoying life! Looking forward to catching up with friends and loved ones. But tonight: [[flow]] in the [[Agora of Flancia]]!
