- Soon :)
- I’m liking [[beeper]] a lot, here’s my [[beeper]] (which is [[matrix]]): https://matrix.to/#/@flancian:beeper.com
- I [[cried]].
  - A [[relative]] send [[30 year old videos]] my way and it was quite an experience to watch them!
  - It felt like relief in some way.
- [[Flancia]]
  - [[Flancia meet]]: at https://meet.evolix.org/flancia
- Read about [[Ahriman]] and [[Zoroastrianism]].
- Trying to figure out how to make [[silverbullet]]:
  - Easily create daily pages for me.
    - For now I need to go to another page and link the current date; or just create a page with the date as its name manually. [[Suboptimal]], although not terrible.
    - Update: it seems the [[Template]] [[plug]] is the way to go: https://silverbullet.md/Plugs/Template
      - Quote: The {[Open Daily Note]} command navigates (or creates) a daily note .
  - Let me navigate to the previous page.
    - This is easy actually, just alt-left as per browser conventions.
  - Now reading about [[plugs]]
