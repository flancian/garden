# Movies

- I [[like]] them but I don't watch as many as I'd like as of late.
- It's hard to make the time for them? In particular when there's so much stuff to do, and when there are so many other media fighting for our attention.
- [[series]] might be taking over, but honestly you can watch movies as if they were series perfectly fine -- just watch them in 23 minutes or 40 minutes stints. I'm not a fundamentalist.
