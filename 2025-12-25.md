- Very nice day at home with Burup :)
- Ended up working 8h on projects and making good progress, which felt great! Pretty much as planned.
- Then in the evening I went back to [[Bitwäscherei]]/[[SGMK]] after long and it felt great as well, I hadn't been back much since April (?) because of travel/work/personal life and my under-prioritizing. I intend to come back more often now!
