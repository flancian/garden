- Most of what I write in the Agora nowadays seems to be [[poems]] :)
- Aside from that I've been mostly focusing on [[Agora development]] when I dedicate time to the #Agora directly.
- I have been enjoying the addition of AI to the developer's toolset, have been going through bug fixes and old wishlist items with much more speed. I am thankful for the opportunity.
- In other news I am happy with [[Lady Burup]] and [[KM]] and life in general!
- I have also been dedicating a large amount of time to work and trying to enjoy it, to more success than before.
