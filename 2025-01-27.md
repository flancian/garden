- Noding this from [[bull]] in today's page in the Agora, meaning anagora.org/2025-01-27; I wonder if this will create a 2025-01-27.md file or somehow just a 'bare' 2025-01-27 file. I'll know soon enough :)
- Had lunch with [[Stapelberg]] and it was great as usual. We discussed work and open source; bull and the agora.
- I finally bought the tickets for Argentina and Brazil! It feels nice to get that out of the way.
- Work was fine!
- After work, there was a short Social.coop [[TWG]] meeting with [[Dan Phiffer]] and it was great.
- [[Lady Burup]] is very beautiful and a great companion as always!
