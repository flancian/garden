- [[23]] is [[Lady Burup]]'s day :)
  - A chill day at home, with snow outside. I'm taking care of [[AG]] a bit as she's sick.
- Todo for the day:
  - rest :)
  - [ ] fix mastodon embeds in the Agora? they are still broken after most instances updated to 4.3
    - I didn't quite fix this yet but I found two bugs doing this and made progress :)
    - First, social.coop embed.js had not been updated in years. We need a step to update static content when updating the instance! I mentioned it in the room.
    - Second, I filed https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/33049 against Mastodon. I don't get how their "new style" embeds are supposed to work, embed.js seems a bit weird. Let's see what they say.
  - [ ] work: on that work document at least for one pomodoro
  - [ ] work: book meetings for the upcoming week (see paper notebook)
  - [x] social.coop: CWG oncall
    - Some spam reports.
    - No new registrations since yesterday.
  - [ ] social.coop: TWG next steps towards alpha.social.coop 
    - Hmm, what does this mean?
    - I guess I should fill that form to get a VPS from iocoop now that we have joined! That sounds simple enough/fun.
