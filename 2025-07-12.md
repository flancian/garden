- Back here after a long while!
- I spent ten days with my mum in [[Calp]], [[Spain]] -- I expected to write and code a lot, as I usually do (expect, not do, during holidays). In the end we mostly spent time in the sea or the pool, spoke, read and played [[Rummy]]. I have no regrets!
- As I write this, we are in the [[Alicante]] airport waiting for our flight. I am looking forward to being reunited with [[Lady Burup]]!
