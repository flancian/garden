  - > SenseCraft is a [[role-playing game]] where teams co-construct structured conversations. It is currently in active development (pre-alpha) stage. People can ask high-level questions by creating quests, and members of guilds who take up the challenge will assume certain [[roles]] to contribute to a [[shared conversation tree]].
