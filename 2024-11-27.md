- I woke up with a headache for some reason, and it came back during the day, but otherwise I was fine.
- I worked and then attended the [[end of year dinner]] with my coworkers.
  - There was also a [[bowling]] afternoon event which I skipped as I felt I was too behind work and I wanted to use the opportunity to catch up.
  - Even as I decided to skip it I knew that, with the passage time, I would remember the bowling event but not the afternoon working. But I decided to do it anyway as I also knew my mental state would be affected by not making progress on some tasks, and I think in the end it was a reasonable choice.
  - I enjoyed dinner. I actually like my coworkers, I'm lucky in that (and many ways!).
- Then I returned home and I played with [[Lady Burup]] and played the piano.
  - I played [[Amores Hallar√°s]] for the first time in A (what I remembered/whistled) and in B (as per the recording by [[Inti Illimani]]).
