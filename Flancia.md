- a [[project]].
  - [[fully open]] [[transparent]] [[ethical]]
  - In [[Flancia]] they used the [[internet]] to build a global [[Commons]].
    - [[agora]]
      - [[agora doc]]
  - #pull [[agora]]
    - #pull [[agora of flancia]] exists. You're reading this in it :)
    - I dreamt of seeing an Agora of Flancia with a million [[people]].
    - [[1m people]] is approximately 2000 [[bolos]] :)
    - call it [[2048]] to make it even ;)

For all I talk about the Agora as of late, I often don't talk of Flancia enough, or so sometimes I feel; it is after all to help build Flancia that I built an Agora, and to help build [[your Flancia]], meaning .
