# Middle Way

- I am probably not a real [[buddhist]] according to the definition of at least some other Buddhists, but I am a believer of the [[middle way]].
- My current best short answer for how [[Flancia]] could look like as a working system would be: it's the middle way between capitalism and communism.
- [[compromise]] gets a bad rep but it's key for [[cooperation]].
