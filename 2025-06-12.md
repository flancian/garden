- I met [[P]] when I was in California, it was great!
  - We shook hands on friendship and I'll mean that forever.
  - We might also not talk more any further and that is also OK. I am grateful for having met her.
  - I wish you the best! That goes for [[P]] and for you, reader:
    - May you be free!
    - May you be happy!
- I met [[Teodora]] today through my great friend [[Pesho]], it was also great!
  - We walked home (we live in the same town) taking [[Covid]] precautions because I was to an outdoor party where the host tested positive.
- It was [[AG]]'s birthday and I loved it!
  - It was great seeing her after the long trip.
  - And meeting her friends and family again!
