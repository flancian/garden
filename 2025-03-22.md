- [[nostromo]] died today!
  - after almost dying many times.
  - I thank them for their service! beautiful computer.
  - [[paramita]] was ready to take its spot.
- [[bouncepaw]] told me about [[xremap]] today! it looks great, like it could fix several issues I had in the back of my mind with the input layer in wayland.
