# Bugs

- #go https://github.com/issues
  - Despite my occasional complaints about Github, This is the main public bugtracker I use. I think that's the same for many -- so the go link here points to the page about all issues in Github across any repos :)
- #gitlab https://gitlab.com/flancian/agora/-/issues
  - I used Gitlab more around 2020 and I still store my [[flancian]] (bootstrap) repository there.
