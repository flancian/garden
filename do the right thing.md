- [ ] work on [[autopull]]:
  - make e.g. [[279]] pull [[prime/279]] because it's a number
- [ ] prepare [[guanyin]] for travel
  - [ ] pack more in general :)
- [ ] work on [[activitypub]] and [[betulagora]]:
  - Tymur's original import script could be adopted into [[agora bridge]] and then maybe incrementally modified to hit Betula's [[Activitypub endpoints]].
