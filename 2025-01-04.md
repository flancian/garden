  - Brought up social.agor.ai provisionally, considering which domain to run this on -- and whether to do a [[split domain deployment]].
  - Which one is better as a handle for the Agora bot and a user?
    - @agora@agor.ai?
    - @flancian@agor.ai?
    - @agora@social.agor.ai?
    - @flancian@social.agor.ai?
    - @agora@flancia.agor.ai?
    - @flancian@flancia.agor.ai?
    - @agora@anagora.org?
    - @flancian@anagora.org?
    - They mean different things, of course. All but @agora@social.agor.ai while 'allocating' social.agor.ai require a split domain deployment as per the current setup I'm running for Agoras. It doesn't sound too difficult to try split domains using traefik, I could give it a try. But in that case, should I run these in @agor.ai (shorter/cooler?) or in @flancia.agor.ai (most correct as I'm planning on having this instance handle the usernames in flancia.agor.ai or anagora.org?
  - I think I'm going [[simply social]], meaning social.agor.ai is one instance that different people and agoras can use for social services, and handles are foo@social.agor.ai.
