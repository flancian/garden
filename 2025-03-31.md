- [[Las Jaras]]!
  - It was a great day all in all, I had enough bandwidth to do what I needed to do and start the week well; did also some planning for the upcoming months.
- Had lunch with [[Stapelberg]].
- Worked until 19 or until 21 depending on how you count, I count the latter.
- Threw [[476]] in the [[co2]] meter; it's 17 * 28.
