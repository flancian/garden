 - [[integral theory]]
 - [[buddhist geeks]] podcast:
    - First stage/turning of Buddhism: nirvana as the goal. Arhat. [[theravada]].
    - Second stage: nirvana and samsara joined. Non-dual. Bodhisattva. [[Nagarjuna]]. [[mahayana]
        - [[some rinpoche]]: The Bodhisattva vow is *not* about putting off enlightenment really; you need to know the destination to help others get it. The real point is to just not enter Nirvana and leave Samsara behind; rather to stay in a unified state to serve as a bridge.
    - Third stage accepts the second stage. Buddha nature is a wisdom mind, it is always present. Explores mind states more thoroughly. [[vajrana]].
        - [[kundalini]], "[[energy currents]]", etc. all come in here?
        - The body is a pathway to the spiritual. [[tantra]].
    - Fourth turning: about [[growing up]] (e.g. [[Piaget]], [[Kegan]]) and [[cleaning up]] (psychotherapy?).
