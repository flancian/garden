- [[importance]] 
- [[focus]]
  - for the focus to be sharper, X needs to happen
- [[context]]
- [[push]] [[ahs]]
  - instead of trying to figure out how to solve tangential complexity, a platform to focus on what's the focus of our disciplines
  - a platform for [[scholarship]]
  - what do we need?
    - [[names]] for its components
    - a [[mapping]] from a [[goal]] to all known resources that are known to contribute to the [[goal]], or the other way around
      - this feels like a network plus a [[flow]] problem
    - [[scripts]] that iterate over the data set and take actions
      - reminds me of [[intent based automation]] and [[declarative paradigm]]
