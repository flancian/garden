- I cleaned the house in the morning while I was logged onto [[Flancia meet]] (quiet instance, but that's alright of course) and it felt good to start the weekend that way; I did kitchen and bathroom floors.
- We had a tough conversation with [[AG]] today, but I think it was the right thing.
- I wrote a script named [[Burup]] to disable the laptop's keyboard and touchpad so Burup can sleep on it while I continue to use the external keyboard and mouse for browsing/coding :)
