	- [[sorting pushes]]
	- [[pull arbitrary urls]]
		- pull wikipedia works
		- fix duplicate [[go links]] behaviour
	- [[write]] [[on building bridges]]
		- [[write]] [[topology]]
	- [[read]] [[category theory]]
		- measures/metrics for 'distance to isomorphism'?
		- e.g. measures of information loss in transforms
		- seems to map to complexity of convergence in computation / difficulty to [[merge]]
		- [[topology]]
	- Write about [[excursion]].
	- [[onkyo volume]]
		- ? meh
	- Write about [[music mouse]].
		- Write a post about my [[virtual desktop setup]].
		- [[pull]] means [[uprank]]
	- implement [[autopull]] and [[autopush]]
		- check out [[gtoolkit]]
		- [[javascript subnodes]]. Think about how they interact with functionality like [[auto pull]], which I disabled by default due to performance issues and would prefer to make into an async call.
		- see [[js util]] by [[vera]]
		- [[push]] [[plurals auto pull]]
		- equals better treatment for [[lists]]
			- [[force directed graph]] must auto pull [[force directed graphs]]
			- that is, auto pull plurals
		- fixes a common search case now broken (as we only do [[exact match]] plus resolution of user-specified, so explicit, [[pulls]])
		- auto pull makes 'or' behaviour of search trivially implementable
		- auto pulls are [[action code]] that implements a [[morphism]]
		- any search policy/ranking can be expressed as a composition of morphisms
	- [[push]] [[vscode]] [[foam]]
		- see if there's a way to color/annotate panes in [[vscode]]
		- could aid mnemonically
