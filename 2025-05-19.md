- Noding from work after a while! I spend a lot of time here writing but for obvious reasons I don't tend to write in the Agora while at it. Still, I would like to take up the habit again of writing more journals so I thought I'd give it a shot.
- I met [[Stapelberg]] for lunch as we often do on Mondays and it was great.
  - I heard of an upcoming [[nix hackathon]] from him.
- Now I have a bunch of meetings upcoming; more than planned (as it tends to happen). I'll try to make the most of it, and still protect enough time blocks that I can do what I intended to get done during the workday (without going too late into the night).
