- Yesterday I implemented 'star nodes' and fixed a bunch of stuff in the Agora with Gemini and it felt great :)
  * I was able to do this in parallel while I kept working (day job related) into the end of night; I enjoy this pairing.
  * I use two different computers in two different desks and I walk to and fro, which helps a lot.
