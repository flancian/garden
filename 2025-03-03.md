- Picked up my laptop after long. This has been quite an offline vacation!
- In [[Buzios]] this week, reading about:
  - [[Beppo]], [[Borges]]'s cat.
  - [[Lord Byron]].
- Also reading a compilation of short stories by [[Greg Egan]] :)
- After a day by the beach, we went on a walk with [[AG]] to a lookout point near [[Ferradura]].
