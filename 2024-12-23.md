- Back home!
  - After 15 days spent in the US west coast (working) and then Japan (traveling with friends).
  - I slept home in Oerlikon alone as I crashed not so long after arriving due to jet lag; [[AG]] will come with [[Lady Burup]] later today.
  - I woke up at 6am after only 7 hours of sleep due to jetlag despite only getting five hours yesterday and I decided to just get up and start doing things; I'll try to take a nap later today as needed.
- Non-prioritized list of things I want to take a look at now that come to mind and I wanted to jot down:
  - [[Cline]] -- I heard it's a good AI plugin for [[vscode]] that is not too opinionated/walled-gardeny (is that a word? maybe it should be)
  - [[Posty]] -- something cooked by [[Oliphant]] over at the Fediverse which sounds a lot like something I wanted to build/I wanted to see someone build)
  - This [[talk by Dan Dennett]] who passed away this year.
  - [[social.coop]] activity -- some threads on Mastodon, some on Matrix, some on Loomio surely
