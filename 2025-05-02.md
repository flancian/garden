- [[2025-05-01]]: [[International Workers Day]] was nice, although I didn't sleep very well and I had to pack/do things in the house to prepare for travel so I left the festivities relatively early in the afternoon after attending with friends.
- As I write this I'm in the [[Zürich airport]] waiting to board my flight to Málaga for a week in southern Spain.
