- I was part of the [[Bitw√§scherei]]/[[SGMK]] [[Easter Hack]] this long weekend and it was great! Met interesting people, and was able to focus well on tasks I had long deferred, partly because of being surrounded by people also focused on their projects.
- Also spent Easter Sunday with friends and their family, it was very nice!
- Still noding actions in [[2025]].
