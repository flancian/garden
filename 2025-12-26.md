- Met:
    - Some cool people on the rooftop of [[Zentralwäscherei]], including a girl named something like [[Katja]] and her two cool friends.
    - [[Moritz]] after midnight in [[Bitwäscherei]].
    - I also saw [[Marc]] and [[Aaron]] after long!
    - I'm so glad I came back to [[SGMK]] finally; it just kept slipping because of work and commitments, it seems I needed a long weekend to get pressing things done and reboot priorities :)
- Then slept ~6h roughly from 6am to 12am and woke up rested enough :)
- Played [[Minecraft]] with [[KI]] and it was great!
- Then flowed.
- Ran again into [[What is Life?]] by [[Schrödinger]], decided to actually locate a URL where I could read it.
