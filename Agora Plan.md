- Wow, it's been long since I was here.
- Long enough that last time I was here I wasn't yet using the Agora in its current configuration, so my writing was going to an all lower case filename in my digital garden.
- So, well, I guess I could take this opportunity to start anew :)

The Agora is a Knowledge Commons built for the benefit of sentient beings.
