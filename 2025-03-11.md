- Loved the [[15 minutes]] flow
- Played [[The Reluctant Groom]], plus [[Lady Burup]]'s song :)
- Back here something like 22 hours later, on the other side of the night and day and half there over :)
  - Work including oncall was occasionally heavy but still good, felt productive. Worked late and advanced some threads enough, but not as late as yesterday!
