  - like [[advent of code]], but chiller.
  - by [[eli]].
  - [[bouncepaw]] told me about it.
  - I did it in [[2023]] and I'm doing it as of the time of writing in [[2024]].
    - I'll be doing [[Agora development]] freely through the month, dedicating time to projects I've wanted to advance for a while -- and also having some days of what I call [[free play]] :)
