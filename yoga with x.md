Welcome to [[yoga with x]]! This is episode... well, I've stopped counting, but they are all meant to be published.

## [[2022-10-30]]

This is [[go/move/30]]. Maybe for the first time with Adriene's full audio?
I'm privileged to have a dishwasher, in that as in many other ways!
In case you're wondering, those dishes are clean :)

## [[2022-11-06]]

[[Working in public]] tonight. I see yoga and working as two strands in a beautiful braid.

In case you're wondering, those dishes are dirty :) But you didn't because the dishwasher was closed by the time we started yoga, and you also didn't because I didn't record it today, although I did broadcast in [[go/yoga with x]] as usual. The mirror images / views on the so called [[self]] are useful.

## [[2023-01-20]] leading into [[2023-01-21]]

- doing [[center]] with [[Adriene]] this January, and probably most of [[2023]].
  - I did the same with [[move]] in [[2022]].
  - e.g. [[center 18]] https://youtu.be/cCf68mi6r-I
