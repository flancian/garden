# yoga with x
- a [[project]].
	- [[mashup]] or [[remix]].
		- a [[playlist]] and potentially a set of tools to make it easier for people to coordinate massively online over platforms such as [[youtube]], focused on doing [[yoga]] together.
	- inspired by [[yoga with adriene]], which I'm a big fan of.
