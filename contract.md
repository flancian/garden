# CONTRACT
- I endorse the base [[contract]] of this Agora which is just [[an agora]], anagora.org.
- Contracts are [[lists]] of assertions; they can be assumed to include declarations of [[knowledge]] and [[belief]] as expressed in [[notes]] and [[resources]] volunteered to this [[agora]].
	- These assertions are sometimes organized in [[trees]] and [[graphs]] using the structured allowances given by this [[agora]] as expressed in [[agora protocol]] and [[agora rfcs]].
- I [[intend]] to dedicate a [[meaningful fraction]] of my [[free time]] and [[resources]] to improve the world.
	- [[push]] [[manifesto]]
		- I am a [[Flancian]] and this is my [[manifesto]]:
			- In [[Flancia]] there is no [[poverty]].
			- In [[Flancia]] there is no [[privilege]].
			- In [[Flancia]] we will one day [[meet]].
- Through this [[Agora]] I try to contribute to the development of a freer, open, progressive global society and projects or [[public utility]].
- Because I am unskillful, I need your help. I am open to any [[feedback]] anytime. I am active on social media.
