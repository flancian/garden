- And I'm back!
  - Says the person who keeps going away :)
  - But I come back happily.
- Some days I dedicate very few cycles to the Agora. Instead I tend to focus on: work, family, friends and thoughts.
  - That's alright! Or more than alright actually.
- To the [[readers of the future]] I say:
  - Thank you for being here!
  - Please excuse any bumps in the ride :)
