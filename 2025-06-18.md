- And I'm back!
  - Says the person who keeps going away :)
  - But I come back happily.
- Some days I dedicate very few cycles to the [[Agora]]. Instead I tend to focus on: work, family, friends and thoughts.
  - That's alright! Or more than alright actually.
- To the [[readers of the future]] I say:
  - Thank you for being here!
  - Please excuse any bumps in the ride :)

As I we pass mid-June I am:

- Thinking of the women in my life
- Enjoying the visit of my mum!
- Enjoying life in general.

I now intend to:

- Take out the remaining paper for recycling.
- Fix Agora bugs!
  - Marginalia -> Google as the marginalia.nu iframe has issues
  - Maybe a [[scroll to bottom]] button, keep it simple :)
