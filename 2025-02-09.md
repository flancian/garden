- Back noding in [[neovim]] to make sure I keep my travel setup running.
  - I could also move to running [[bull]] locally in [[guanyin]] while I travel...
- Started the day nicely with [[AG]].
- Then did [[Sadhana]], things around the house, and advanced on many threads :)
  - During the week I finished the two trivial bull PRs I wanted to get in.
  - [ ] Now I'm thinking of shifting to a different PR (which?) and to [[Betula]], [[Social.coop]] and [[Agora]] work.
  - [x] Sending something to the [[M&Ms]] :)
    - I enjoyed the process a lot! I hope they enjoy the result, even a subset :)
- Thought about:
  - [[primes]], and again [[prime gaps]], which I now associate with the number #14 because 14 is a first notable prime gap on 113 - 127, and it easily answers 'prime?' for an interesting range
