  - [[quote]] [[FOAF]] (an acronym of friend of a friend) is a machine-readable ontology describing persons, their activities and their relations to other people and objects.
  - [[quote]] FOAF is (...) expressed using the Resource Description Framework ([[RDF]]) and the Web Ontology Language ([[OWL]]).
  - [[quote]] [[tim berners-lee]], in a 2007 essay, redefined the semantic web concept into the [[Giant Global Graph]], where relationships transcend networks and documents. He considers the [[GGG]] to be on equal ground with the Internet and the World Wide Web, stating that "I express my network in a FOAF file, and that is a start of the [[revolution]]."
