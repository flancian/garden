# Flancian's digital garden

- Welcome to my [[digital garden]]!
  - This garden is part of the [Agora](https://anagora.org/agora) and can be found rendered in https://anagora.org/. If you're viewing this on Github, Gitlab or some other [[git]] host, you will likely have a suboptimal experience (wikilinks may not work).
  - If you'd like help setting up a [[digital garden]] like this one for yourself, please reach out to me in any way you find convenient: [[flancian]].
  - For more information about my other projects, please refer to https://flancia.org.
  - If you'd like to see this graphed, see [[agora graphs]].
  - See also [[flancian repo]].
