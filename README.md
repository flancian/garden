# Welcome to Flancian's digital garden!

- This is my [[digital garden]] or [[personal knowledge graph]].
  - If you're viewing this as a [[git]] repository host, you will likely have a suboptimal experience; in particular, [[wikilinks]] may not work. Whenever you read something in [[double square brackets]], just know that you can resolve that link by visiting https://anagora.org/double+square+brackets or similar.
  - If you'd like help setting up a [[digital garden]] like this one for yourself, please reach out to me in any way you find convenient: [[flancian]].
  - For more information about some of my other projects, please refer to https://flancia.org
  - This garden is part of the [Agora of Flancia](https://anagora.org/agora), an experimental social knowledge graph, and can be found rendered with others in https://anagora.org/
