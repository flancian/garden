- Mi mam√° tose mucho mientras duerme :(
  - Espero que se le pase pronto!
  - En todo caso la pasamos muy bien en Calp! Me hizo muy bien.
- I am now writing in [[tara]], the "main" project computer as of now :)
  - I have just [[meditated]].
  - I am thankful for existence!
  - I am thinking of my commitment to try to work for the benefit of sentient beings.
- Also I am wondering why nvim in [[guanyin]] is sort of broken, extensions that work fine in [[paramita]] and [[tara]] don't quite behave like I expect here. I suspect a [[chezmoi]] conflict, let's see...
    - (These are the sidequests that make up so much of life... I try to enjoy them!)
    - I am tying this on my new keyboard, a [[Royal Kludge]] :)
      - It is the smallest keyboard I have typed on in very long, but I am happy to report it works! Maybe I wouldn't use it for coding initially as some key combinations I use are relatively awkward to press (it involves extra modifiers), but it is very pleasant to type prose or [[Agora]] text in which I'm very happy about, and it seems to easily support three bluetooth connections.

        - (See, [[nvim]] is indenting for some reason when I start a new line while doing outlines... I'm rolling with it for now...)
          - (OK, I spoke too soon, it turns out that [[paramita]] is broken too! Editing wise. So it *could* be I have fixed nvim only in [[tara]] and forgot to push that change to [[chezmoi]]...)
  - Hmm
    - Yep, it's fixed in Tara!
    - How nice to have a working vim based setup for the Agora again ;)
    - Now to figure out why it's broken elsewhere \o/
